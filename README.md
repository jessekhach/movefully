## Authentication Flow

### Primary: Apple Sign-In (Recommended)
1. **Launch**: App checks for existing authentication
2. **Apple Sign-In**: One-tap authentication with Face ID/Touch ID
3. **Firebase Integration**: Apple ID token exchanges for Firebase auth
4. **Role Selection**: New users choose trainer or client role
5. **Dashboard**: Navigate to role-specific dashboard

### Secondary: Email/Password
- Available as "Continue with Email" option
- Traditional sign-up/sign-in flow
- Same role selection and dashboard flow

### Authentication Persistence
- Authentication state persists across app launches
- Apple Sign-In provides seamless re-authentication
- Automatic token refresh through Firebase

## Firebase Configuration

The app uses Firebase for backend services with Apple Sign-In integration:

1. **GoogleService-Info.plist**: Contains Firebase project settings
2. **Apple Sign-In Provider**: Enabled in Firebase Authentication
3. **Environment Variables**: Located in `.env.local` and `.env.production`

### Firestore Database Structure

```
users/{userId} {
  "role": "trainer" | "client",
  "name": string,
  "email": string,
  "createdAt": timestamp
}
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Xcode 15.0 or later
- iOS 15.0+ deployment target
- Firebase project with Authentication and Firestore enabled
- Apple Developer Account (for Apple Sign-In)

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url]
   cd movefully
   ```

2. **Open in Xcode**
   ```bash
   open Movefully.xcodeproj
   ```

3. **Firebase Setup**
   - Ensure `GoogleService-Info.plist` is included in the project
   - Verify Apple Sign-In is enabled in Firebase Console

- FirebaseFirestore (Database)
- FirebaseStorage (File storage)

## Design Philosophy

### Authentication Experience
- **Frictionless**: Apple Sign-In reduces signup barriers
