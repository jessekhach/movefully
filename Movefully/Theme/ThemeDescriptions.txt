🎨 Movefully UI Theme for Cursor

iOS target = iOS 16+

🖼️ Overall Feel
Soft, clean, and inviting
Feels more like a wellness app than a gym tracker
Prioritizes comfort, calm, and clarity over performance or “intensity”
🎨 Color Palette
Use a pastel-inspired, wellness-focused palette with soft contrast and positive tones.

Primary Brand Color

Soft Aqua / Teal (e.g., #56C2C6 or similar)
Used for primary actions (e.g., Invite button, highlights)
Accent Colors

Warm Orange for alerts or "Needs Attention" (e.g., #F4A261)
Soft Green for “Active” (e.g., #70C18C)
Gentle Blue for “New” or info states (e.g., #6FB1FC)
Lavender or Orchid for “Pending Invite” (e.g., #C69AE3)
Medium Gray for muted/paused states (#B0B0B0)
Backgrounds & Neutrals

App background: #FAFAFA (off-white, not pure white)
Cards: White with soft shadows or borders
Text:
Headings: #333333
Body: #4F4F4F

🧱 Component Design
Rounded Corners (all components, 12–16pt radius)
Shadows should be soft and subtle (avoid harsh elevation)
Cards float slightly off the background for hierarchy
Buttons use solid fill or pill style, never full-width edge to edge
📝 Typography
Use a modern, calming typeface — ideally native to iOS for performance but styled softly.

Recommended Fonts:

SF Pro Rounded or SF Pro Display (built-in for iOS)
Rounded edge feel is preferred
Font Weights:
Bold for names, section headers
Regular for body text
Light or Medium for helper text or captions
Text Sizes:

Title: 22–24 pt
Section headers: 17–19 pt
Body: 15–17 pt
Captions / metadata: 13–14 pt
🔄 Interactions
Use soft animations for transitions (fade, slide-up)
Taps should give subtle haptic feedback where appropriate
Form inputs should be large, clean, and spaced — never cramped
🧘‍♀️ Overall Inspiration
Think:

Apple Fitness' onboarding screens
Headspace’s visual gentleness
The calm, focused structure of apps like Whoop or Balance
